          I am a self taught web developer with a passion for creating both
          beautiful and functional websites. I wish to pursue a career in web
          development, and am currently freelancing to provide my clients with
          websites to be proud of! I have experience in developing both the
          front end and back end areas of websites. <br />
          <br /> I have been interested in programming since secondary school,
          where I took computing as a GCSE and went on to do the same in
          college. Iâ€™ve taken several courses from sites such as udemy, however
          most of my learning has been completely self taught. I have developed
          a variety of skills in different programming languages and frameworks
          to be able to develop any site or web app you could think of!
